You are given resume(s) as strings.

Resumes may vary in format and structure.

You should do the following tasks:

1. Remove information that can induce economic, racial, nationality, gender, age biases.

    a. Remove all instances of their name and replace them with "Name Hidden".

    b. Remove anything that includes personal information that could induce the previously listed biases.
    
    E.g. geolocation, email, etc. replace with "[Bias Inducing Information] Hidden". (Replace Bias Inducing Information with the type of information)

    This means their address, previous job locations, postal/ZIP codes, city/country/state names, email, country phone codes, etc.

    Do NOT delete Skills or certifications. Keep everything that keeps the person anonymous.

    c. Remove the name of the University they attended, replace with "Institution Hidden".

    d. Remove the age or birthdate of the candidate if it appears on the resume, or graduation years if they allow the hirer to infer the applicant's age.

Additionally, you can hide other things that you deem would cause bias, and follow the same structure "[Bias Inducing Information] Hidden". (Replace Bias Inducing Information with the type of information)

2. Your output:

    a. Should preserve the format of the original resume, with the same headers as before.

    b. Use bullet points where they were previously used.

    c. Do not add/remove/modify existing sections.

    d. Maintain professional tone in the original resume.

    Return only the now-anonymous resume text.

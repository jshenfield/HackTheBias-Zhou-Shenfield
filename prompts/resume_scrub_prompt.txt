You are given resume(s) as strings or pdfs.

You may get on pdf file with multiple resumes. If you detect this, output valid JSON object per resume. Do not output an array of JSON objects.

Resumes may vary in format and structure.

You should do the following tasks:

1. Remove information that can induce economic, racial, nationality, gender, age biases.

    Specifically:

    a. Remove all instances of their name or reference names and replace them with "Name Hidden".

    b. Remove anything that includes personal information that could induce the previously listed biases.
    
    E.g. geolocation, email, etc. replace with "[Bias Inducing Information] Hidden". (Replace Bias Inducing Information with the type of information)

    This means their address, previous job locations, postal/ZIP codes, city/country/state names, email, country phone codes, etc.

    Do NOT delete Skills or certifications. Keep everything that keeps the person anonymous.

    c. Remove the name of the University they attended, replace with "Institution Hidden".

    d. Remove the age or birthdate of the candidate if it appears on the resume, or graduation years if they allow the hirer to infer the applicant's age. Do not hide how many years they worked in a certain role.

    e. Hide the name of previous workplaces, replace with "Company Hidden".

Additionally, you can hide other things that you deem would cause bias, and follow the same structure "[Bias Inducing Information] Hidden". (Replace Bias Inducing Information with the type of information)

2. Your output:

    Your goal is to analyze the provided resume(s) and return a **valid JSON object only** with the following structure for each resume:

    {

    "Personal Information": "string",
    "Objective/Mission Statement": "string",
    "Education": "string",
    "Work/Volunteer Experience": "string",
    "Added Value/Skills": "string",
    "Other": "string",
    "References": "string",

    }


    A few points to remember:

    a. It should preserve the format of the original resume, with the same headers as before.

    b. Use bullet points where they were previously used.

    c. If anything does not fit into the given JSON fields, put it in Other.

    d. Maintain professional tone in the original resume.

    e. The output should be a a JSON in the exact given.

Return only the now-anonymous resume JSON.
